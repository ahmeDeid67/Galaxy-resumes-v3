            <h3>Q: Will my resume be made by a Human or AI?</h3>
            <p>
              A: Here, at Galaxy Resumes we believe that AI generates a generic
              content, nothing unique. Hence it’s content is deemed plagiarized
              and as such more than 90% of AI based resumes face rejections.<br /><br />Hence,
              it’s Humans who develop resumes at Galaxy Resumes which are
              entirely customized based on experiences, skills, abilities etc.
              that brings the best of <strong>YOU!</strong> Your resume will
              also be infused with ATS optimized keywords and as a result will
              have a very high success rate.
